If you are tired of using `if (!unintuitiveStatement)` you can now suck on my syntatic sugar with...
## jQuery Unless

## Use  
    $.unless(
      function () {
        // unless this statement evaluates true...
      },
      function () {
        // ... do this
      }
    );

- intuitive
- beautiful
- sexy
- fun
